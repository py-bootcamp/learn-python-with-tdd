# Learn Python with Test-driven development

This project is based and inspired by [Learn Go With Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/).

## Why

* Explore the Python language by writing tests
* **Get a grounding with TDD**. Python is a good language for learning TDD because it is a simple language to learn and has a powerful testing library
* Be confident that you'll be able to start writing robust, well-tested systems in Python
* [Watch a video, or read about why unit testing and TDD is important](meta/why.md)

## Table of contents

### Python fundamentals

1. [Install Python](install-python.md) - Set up environment for productivity.
2. [Hello, world](hello-world.md) - Declaring variables, constants, if/else statements, dict, write your first Python program and write your first test.
3. [Integers](integers.md) - Further Explore function and learn new ways to improve the documentation of your code.
4. [Iteration](iteration.md) - Learn about `for` and `range`.
5. [Lists](lists.md) - Learn about lists, `len`, `*args` and test coverage.
