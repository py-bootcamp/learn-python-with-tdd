# Learn Python with TDD

## Formats

- [Gitbook](https://learn-python-with-tdd.pybootcamp.com)

## Why

* Explore the Python language by writing tests
* **Get a grounding with TDD**. Python is a good language for learning TDD because it is a simple language to learn and testing is built-in
* Be confident that you'll be able to start writing robust, well-tested systems in Python
* [Watch a video, or read about why unit testing and TDD is important](why.md)

## Table of contents

### Python fundamentals

1. [Install Python](install-python.md) - Set up environment for productivity.
2. [Hello, world](hello-world.md) - Declaring variables, constants, if/else statements, switch, write your first go program and write your first test. Sub-test syntax and closures.

### Build an application

Now that you have hopefully digested the _Python Fundamentals_ section you have a solid grounding of a majority of Python's language features and how to do TDD.

This next section will involve building an application.

Each chapter will iterate on the previous one, expanding the application's functionality as our product owner dictates.

New concepts will be introduced to help facilitate writing great code but most of the new material will be learning what can be accomplished from Python's standard library.

### Questions and answers

I often run in to questions on the internets like

> How do I test my amazing function that does x, y and z

If you have such a question raise it as an issue on github and I'll try and find time to write a short chapter to tackle the issue. I feel like content like this is valuable as it is tackling people's _real_ questions around testing.
